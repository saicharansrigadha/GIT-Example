ViewModel & Repository testing

7. Advanced Topics

Coroutines & Flow (structured concurrency, exception handling, cancellation)

Paging 3 (infinite scrolling)

Performance optimization (memory leaks, profiler tools)

Services, Broadcast Receivers, Notifications

Runtime Permissions

8. Tooling

Git (branching, PR workflow)

Gradle basics (build types, flavors)

Android Studio profilers & debugging

CI/CD (basic knowledge, e.g. GitHub Actions, Firebase App Distribution)

9. Soft Skills / Best Practices

Writing clean, readable, maintainable code

Following SOLID principles

Knowledge of Material Design Guidelines

Writing proper commit messages & documentation

10. Extra (Nice-to-have)

Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Push Notifications, Crashlytics)

Jetpack Compose animations

Basics of Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) / Flutter awareness (bonus for future growth)

✅ With 1.5 years of experience, you should master the fundamentals + modern Android (Jetpack + Coroutines/Flow) and show that you can build, test, and ship maintainable apps.

👉 Do you want me to create a learning priority list (what to focus first, second, etc.) so you don’t feel overwhelmed?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 Let’s build a priority-based learning plan for you (1.5 yrs Android exp).
This will help you upgrade to mid-level developer without getting overwhelmed.

📌 Learning Priority List (Android Dev, 1.5 Yrs Exp)
🎯 Priority 1 – Must Master (Core Skills)

👉 These are non-negotiable; interviewers expect you to be strong here.

Kotlin (Intermediate)

Coroutines (launch, async/await, withContext, exception handling)

Flows → StateFlow & SharedFlow basics

Extension functions, lambdas, higher-order functions

Android Core

Activity & Fragment lifecycle (deep understanding)

RecyclerView + DiffUtil

ViewBinding

Jetpack Basics

ViewModel + LiveData (or StateFlow)

Room (DB) with suspend functions

Navigation Component

✅ Mini project: Todo App (Room + ViewModel + Coroutines + Nav).

🎯 Priority 2 – Modern Android (Next Level)

👉 This makes you stand out from juniors.

Jetpack Compose (must in 2025)

DataStore (replacing SharedPreferences)

WorkManager (background tasks)

Retrofit + OkHttp + Coroutines

MVVM Architecture (Repository pattern)

✅ Mini project: Weather App (API + Room cache + Compose UI).

🎯 Priority 3 – Professional Skills

👉 Adds maturity to your code & projects.

Dependency Injection → Hilt (preferred)

Clean Architecture basics (UseCase, Repository, DI layers)

Unit Testing (JUnit, Mockito)

Git workflows (PRs, branching, code reviews)

Material Design guidelines

✅ Mini project: News Reader App (Paging 3 + Hilt + Clean Architecture).

🎯 Priority 4 – Advanced Topics (Career Booster)

👉 These push you towards mid-senior dev.

Flows (combine, debounce, flatMapLatest)

Paging 3 (infinite scrolling feeds)

Services, Notifications, Broadcast Receivers

Performance optimization (Profiler, LeakCanary)

CI/CD basics (GitHub Actions / Firebase App Distribution)

✅ Mini project: Chat App with Firebase (Auth + Firestore + Notifications).

🎯 Priority 5 – Nice-to-Have / Future Growth

👉 Not urgent, but helps you grow faster than peers.

Firebase (Analytics, Crashlytics, Remote Config)

Compose animations & advanced UI

Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) basics

Flutter awareness (just high-level)

✅ Mini project: Fitness Tracker App with Firebase backend.

🚀 Roadmap Order (Summary)

Core Android + Coroutines/Flow ✅

Jetpack (Room, ViewModel, Nav, Compose basics) ✅

Architecture (MVVM + Hilt + Clean Arch) ✅

Professional skills (Testing, Git, Material) ✅
